[structure](https://github.com/davidlumley/structure)
===========

A simple structure for your web[site/application].

Structure can be used standalone, or you can use the `SCSS` files to customise it.

By including `structure/variables` first, you can then override any variables that are important to you (such as `header-height`) and then include `structure/elements` to have these reflected in the layout.
